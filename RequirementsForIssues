Requirements for the issues:

1) Draw Over Image Issue-

Current Scenario : The field has a label "Draw Over Image". The image is rendered based on this hardcoded label text. It also has properties 'title,'plus','barcode enabled','subtitle' and 'type'.

Requirements : A unique key is required to render images for the required field. A new key can be added or changes can be made to the existing key.

2) Complete Call Issue-

Current Scenario : Complete call api is hit only when all the clinical forms are filled. The payload is type 'json' which has a list of all the clinical forms, with each of their respective fields mapped to their value.

Requirements : A new api has to be created with a payload of just a single form fields, instead of the list.

3) GPS Issue -

Current Scenario : Location is being sent and recieved by frontend and backend respectively, for both admin and clinical forms, so the issue is unclear at the moment.
